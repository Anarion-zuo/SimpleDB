# Simple DB

SimpleDB is the homework project of the course MIT 6.830. This repository is for the purpose of save-keeping of my implementation as I work on the course material.

This repository keeps a original version forked from this [repo](https://github.com/MIT-DB-Class/simple-db-hw) on the `skeleton` branch. The `master` branch is of my own development. Please honor your collab policy!

The following is the content of the original `README.md`.
